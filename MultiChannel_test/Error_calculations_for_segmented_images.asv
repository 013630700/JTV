% First phantom, im1
white_pixels1 = nnz(target1)/(N*N);
% Second phantom
white_pixels2 = nnz(target2)/(N*N);
% Treshold the images so that the amount of white pixels is correct. Here
% the values are between 0 and 1, but they have also other values.

% Calculate the amount of wrong pixels. First we need to decide which
% pixels we set as zero and which will have number 1. We want that kind of
% treshold, which gives us the right amount of white pixels.
% There ratio should be 0.41 in the first reconstruction and 0.25 in the second.
% So in the first reco we want nnz(im3) to be 6717. We get this number of
% white pixels with the following treshold 0.3354.
